# SVG
### SVG Project for Drawing on the Web

This is an SVG I made for a class, Drawing on the Web, at NYU.

I really like geometric representations of different objects such as hearts, animals,

etc. I thought it would be cool to make a geometric heart where each triangle was its

own piece, and when you hovered over the different pieces the color would change.
